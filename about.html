        <h1> About Me</h1>
        <p>
            My name is Ron Shaul, and I am 25 years old. 
            I am currently a third-year student at Ruppin Academic Center, where I am studying Industrial Management Engineering.
             One of my passions is traveling, and I love exploring different parts of the world and capturing moments through photography. Over the years, I have had the opportunity to visit many countries, each with its own unique beauty and culture. 
             I am originally from Maalot, a city located in northern Israel, which has been my home for most of my life.
